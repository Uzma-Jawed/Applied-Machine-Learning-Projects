# Applied Machine Learning – Feature Encoding

This repository contains my practice work for **Applied Machine Learning**, focusing on **feature encoding techniques** and applying them to the **Ames Housing dataset** for predicting house prices.

## 📂 Project Contents
- `Applied-ML-FeatureEncoding.ipynb` – Main notebook with all steps:
  - Data loading (Ames Housing dataset)
  - Data cleaning and handling missing values
  - Feature engineering (bathrooms, ratios, house age, etc.)
  - Feature encoding (ordinal, binary, one-hot encoding)
  - Scaling and preprocessing
  - Regression models (KNN & Linear Regression)
  - Model evaluation (MSE and R² score)

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Ames Housing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godofprogramming/ameshousing/data)

**Shared by https://github.com/AQadir44** (for Practice)

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Uzma-Jawed/Applied-Machine-Learning-Projects.git
   cd Practice_Applied_ML_FeatureEncoding.ipynb
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to reproduce results.

## 📈 Results

- KNN Regressor: R² ≈ 0.74

- Linear Regression: R² ≈ 0.88, MSE ≈ 9.35e8

The Linear Regression model performed better, explaining ~88% of the variance in housing prices.

## ✨ Learning Outcome

- Learned to handle .tsv datasets in pandas.

- Practiced feature encoding techniques.

- Applied regression models and evaluated using R² score.

- Built a clean machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn.
